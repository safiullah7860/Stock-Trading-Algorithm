# stock-trading-algorithm
This stock trading algorithm was made in Python using Alpaca API. This algorithm is links to your Alpaca Market's (paper/live trading) account. It successfully buys 3 shares of 
a user specified stock. Obviously, the secret key and secret is hidden in the file, as you have to add your own to sucessfuly link the algorithm to your account. 
Please use my code merely as reference, as I have not finished the algorithm yet, and each user may have different ideas on the algorithm's behaviors. My goal is to make the algorithm
search through markets automatically and buy and sell shares when it think the time is appropriate (using market trends, past chart behavior and news).
